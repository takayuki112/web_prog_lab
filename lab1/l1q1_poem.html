    <h1> My Poem... </h1>
    <h2>Beneath the sky, so wide and blue...</h2>
    <p>
        Beneath the sky, so wide and <b>blue</b>,<br>
        The world turns soft, the air feels <b>new</b>.<br>
        A whisper stirs the trees in <b>rhyme</b>,<br>
        A quiet song that beats in <b>time</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The sun sets low, the stars <b>awake</b>,<br>
        A peaceful calm the night will <b>take</b>.<br>
        And in the dark, so deep, so <b>vast</b>,<br>
        The moments pass, but they will <b>last</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The moon rises high, a silver <b>glow</b>,<br>
        Lighting the path where quiet rivers <b>flow</b>.<br>
        In stillness, time begins to <b>freeze</b>,<br>
        As if the world is at perfect <b>ease</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The wind begins to softly <b>sigh</b>,<br>
        Whispering tales as birds <b>fly</b>.<br>
        The stars above start to <b>twinkle</b> bright,<br>
        Casting shadows in the still of the <b>night</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The flowers bloom in colors <b>bright</b>,<br>
        Bathing in the soft moon's <b>light</b>.<br>
        The air is fresh, the world feels <b>right</b>,<br>
        As dreams take flight in peaceful <b>night</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        A distant owl begins to <b>call</b>,<br>
        Its voice echoing, soft but <b>tall</b>.<br>
        The leaves rustle in the cool <b>breeze</b>,<br>
        A perfect sound that puts the heart at <b>ease</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        As dawn arrives with golden <b>ray</b>,<br>
        The night gives way to the bright new <b>day</b>.<br>
        The stars fade out, the sky turns <b>blue</b>,<br>
        And everything begins again, fresh and <b>new</b>.
    </p>
